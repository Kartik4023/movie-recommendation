# Movie Recommendation System

## Description
The Movie Recommendation System is a simple GUI-based application built using Python's `Tkinter` library. The system allows users to input their preferred movie genres, and it provides personalized movie recommendations from a predefined list. This project showcases basic GUI design and dictionary-based data handling in Python.

---

## Features
- User-friendly GUI for inputting movie genres.
- Recommends movies based on user-specified genres.
- Predefined movie database with multiple genres such as Drama, Action, Comedy, and more.
- Displays categories of available genres for user reference.

---

## Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.x**
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org).
2. **Tkinter**
   - Tkinter is typically bundled with Python installations. You can verify by running:
     ```bash
     python -m tkinter
     ```
   - If Tkinter is not installed, install it using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` on Ubuntu).
